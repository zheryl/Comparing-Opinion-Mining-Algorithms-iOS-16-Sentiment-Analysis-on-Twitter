"COMPARISON OF OPINION MINING ALGORITHMS (DECISION TREE AND NAÏVE BAYES) FOR iOS 16 OPINION CLASSIFICATION ON TWITTER"

This project compares the performance of two machine learning algorithms, Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes, in classifying opinions about iOS 16 based on Twitter data.
Key Features:

    Data Collection: Scraping tweets related to iOS 16 using the Twitter API.
    Preprocessing: Text cleaning steps, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
    Classification: Implementation of Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes algorithms for opinion mining.
    Performance Evaluation: Analysis using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    Visualization: Graphs and tables to compare the performance of both algorithms.

Objective:

To identify the most effective algorithm for classifying opinions about iOS 16, focusing on accuracy and efficiency when applied to social media datasets.
Technologies Used:

    Python (pandas, scikit-learn, nltk)
    Twitter API for data collection
    Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
